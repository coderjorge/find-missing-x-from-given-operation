# find-missing-x-from-given-operation

Have the function MathChallenge(str) take the str parameter, which will be a simple mathematical formula with three numbers, a single operator (+, -, *, or /) and an equal sign (=) and return the digit that completes the equation.
<br />
In one of the numbers in the equation, there will be an x character, and your program should determine what digit is missing.
<br />
For example, if str is "3x + 12 = 46" then your program should output 4.
<br />
The x character can appear in any of the three numbers and all three numbers will be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1000000.
